# Bruinolopy
## Welcome to the Pic10C, group project of Yuxin Qian, Daniel Becerra, Chuqi Bian, and Hao Zheng. 
### We are aiming at creating a monopoly game based on UCLA, while playing around with the basic of Qt and C++ concepts and applications. 
#### This is the first project for most of us, so this is really fun to start with and the process, even though takes us a lot of effort and time, is still enjoyable and meaningful.
##### The UI part is rather simply. Start from a welcomewindow and two subwindows, we have the gaming board where players roll a dice with clicking a mouse, and the character will move correspondingly. Everytime characters land on a tile we have a QWidget for buying or selling or taking money commands. 
##### The underlying game setup contains Bank, Board, Movement, Tile, and Property.
